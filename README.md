# Zorify - Zora Streaming Platform

Forked [https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/zora.gallery/blob/master/LICENSE] and built a streaming layer on top of the Zora Protocol. Specifcally, this platfrom streams audio urls.

Technology used:
- Next.js
- SASS
- TheGraph
- GraphQL

- Firmidable (Magic Auth)
- Metamask

Open protocols demand open streaming. Zora Gallery is a community-operated interface to the [Zora Protocol](https://zora.engineering).
